Project Name
Description
This project is a backend service built with Node.js v20, designed to manage authentication, fabrics, and products. It utilizes Express for routing and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.

Prerequisites
Node.js v20
Docker and Docker Compose
An understanding of RESTful APIs
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
2. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and update it with your environment-specific variables:

env
Copy code
# Example
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENV='development'

# Database Connection Environment Variables
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=admin
DB_DATABASE=test
DATABASE_URL=`postgresql://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_DATABASE}`

#jwt
SECRET=this_is_a_big_scret

# Redis Connection Environment Variables
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

3. Docker Compose
To simplify the setup process, Docker Compose is used to containerize the application and its dependencies. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

Run the following command to build and start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will set up the Node.js application and any other services defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

API Endpoints
The service provides several RESTful endpoints grouped under different routes:

Authentication
POST /api/v1/auth/signin - Sign in a user
POST /api/v1/auth/login - Log in a user
POST /api/v1/auth/logout - Log out a user
Fabric Management
GET /api/v1/fabric - Fetch all fabrics
POST /api/v1/fabric - Create a new fabric
PUT /api/v1/fabric/:id - Update a fabric by ID
DELETE /api/v1/fabric/:id - Delete a fabric by ID
Product Management
GET /api/v1/product/fabric/:fabId - Get all products by fabric ID
GET /api/v1/product/:productId - Get a product by ID
POST /api/v1/product - Create a new product
PUT /api/v1/product/:id - Update a product by ID
DELETE /api/v1/product/:id - Delete a product by ID
Development
For development purposes, you can run the Node.js application outside Docker by first installing the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Then, start the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Make sure to have your environment variables set up correctly as mentioned in the Environment Variables section.

Testing
To run tests, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Ensure you have a testing environment set up and environment variables configured for testing purposes.
